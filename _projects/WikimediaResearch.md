## Bridging the Gap Between Wikipedians and Scientists with Terminology-Aware Translation: A Case Study in Turkish 

<br> This project addresses the gap between the escalating volume of English-to-Turkish Wikipedia translations and the insufficient number of contributors, particularly in technical domains. Leveraging expertise from academics’ collaborative terminology dictionary effort, we propose a pipeline system to enhance translation quality. Our focus is on bridging academic and Wikipedia communities, creating datasets, and developing NLP models for terminology identification and retrieval, and terminology-aware translation. The aim is to foster sustained contributions and improve the overall quality of Turkish Wikipedia articles.

### Goals

The project will focus on the following tasks:

- **High-quality parallel corpora for terminology-aware translation:** We aim to generate 3,000 parallel sentences in English-Turkish containing the following: i)English text annotated with the technical terms, ii) links to correct terminology entries in the database, and iii) edited translations using the correct terminology with Turkish terms. 

- **Term Identification:** Build models to identify the technical terms in a multilingual setup.

- **Term Linking:** Build models to ground the identified terms in a terminology database (if possible). In case the DB does not contain the term, make a notification system for the domain experts.  

- **Terminology-Aware Translation:** We will build post-editing and translation systems that will be constrained with the terminology database.
