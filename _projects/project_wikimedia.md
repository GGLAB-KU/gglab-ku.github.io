**Abstract:** Current automated translation tools struggle with translating terminology-heavy, technical texts effectively. This limitation, combined with a lack of sufficient contributions, has widened the gap between English-to-Turkish Wikipedia translations, particularly in technical fields. Our project seeks to bridge this gap by fostering collaboration between academic and Wikipedia communities to improve the quality of translations. We aim to develop datasets and build NLP models for terminology identification, linking, and terminology-aware translation. As part of our work, we have developed an English-Turkish terminology-based dataset designed to enhance translation models. In this seminar, we will introduce the dataset, outline the processes followed during its creation, and discuss its evaluation and potential applications in improving translation accuracy. Additionally, we will present the results of surveys conducted with both domain experts and Wikipedia contributors to explore their expertise, translation experiences, and engagement with Wikipedia. These findings will shed light on the specific challenges faced by both communities in terminology-based translation.

**Bio:** Gözde Gül Şahin received her Ph.D. from the Computer Engineering Department of Istanbul Technical University, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) under the supervision of Prof. Eşref Adalı. After her Ph.D., she worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the UKP Lab, Technical University of Darmstadt, under the guidance of Prof. Iryna Gurevych. Since February 2022, she has been an Assistant Professor at Koç University, where she is affiliated with [KUIS AI](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/) and [GGLab](https://gglab-ku.github.io/). Her research focuses on advancing NLP through machine learning models and open-access tools/datasets for the world's languages, particularly for underrepresented languages. Her interests also include semantics, procedural language, and the abstraction and reasoning capabilities of large language models.

## Bridging the Gap Between Wikipedians and Scientists with Terminology-Aware Translation: A Case Study in Turkish

</div>

This project addresses the gap between the growing volume of English-to-Turkish Wikipedia translations and the limited number of contributors, particularly in technical domains. By leveraging the collaborative efforts of academics in building terminology dictionaries, we propose a pipeline system to improve translation quality. Our focus is on fostering collaboration between academic and Wikipedia communities, creating datasets, and developing NLP models for terminology identification, retrieval, and terminology-aware translation. The goal is to encourage sustained contributions and enhance the overall quality of Turkish Wikipedia articles.

### Project Goals

The project will focus on the following tasks:

- **High-Quality Parallel Corpora for Terminology-Aware Translation:** We aim to generate 3,000 parallel English-Turkish sentences that include: 
    1. English text annotated with technical terms,
    2. Links to the correct terminology entries in the database,
    3. Edited translations using the correct Turkish terminology.

- **Term Identification:** Develop models to identify technical terms in a multilingual setup.

- **Term Linking:** Build models to link identified terms to a terminology database. If the term is not present in the database, a notification system will alert domain experts to add it.

- **Terminology-Aware Translation:** Develop post-editing and translation systems that adhere to the terminology database to ensure consistent and accurate translations.
