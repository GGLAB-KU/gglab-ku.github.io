I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Koç University and am a first-year M.Sc. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Koç University. Over the past year, I interned under the guidance of Asst. Prof. Gözde Gül Şahin at Koç University working at the topic of cognitive trust and the decision-making similarities between humans and NLP models.
