I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Koç University and now a M.Sc. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Koç University and KUIS AI. As part of my senior design project, I helped develop a web-based tool for [grammatical error detection and correction](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-demos.16/). Before that, I contributed to the [work](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3706599.3720105) to measure cognitive trust and the decision-making similarities between humans and NLP models. Finally I was the lead researcher for the [Wikimedia project](https://gglab-ku.github.io/projects/project_wikimedia/), building a high-quality terminology translation [dataset](aperta.ulakbim.gov.tr/records/286016) and organizing a [shared task](https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/sigturk2026_sharedtask).
