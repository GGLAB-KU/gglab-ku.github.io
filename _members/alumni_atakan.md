I earned my B.S. in Computer Engineering with a double major in Mathematics from Koç University. I have previously interned and held positions related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). During my time at GGLab, I contributed to developing Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) for Turkish. We successfully produced GECTurk, the first extensive dataset specifically for Turkish GEC. Furthermore, we set new standards by introducing several baseline techniques that have set the standard in English over recent years. Moreover, under the guidance of [Asst. Prof. Gözde Gül Şahin](https://gozdesahin.github.io/) and [Prof. Metin Sezgin](https://iui.ku.edu.tr/people/), we developed a [Smart Legal Search Engine](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/atakan-kara-903632173_we-are-thrilled-to-share-that-our-senior-activity-7077316851638091777-aYyo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) as our graduation project. This project was honored as the best Computer Engineering Senior Design project of the year.
