I am a Ph.D. student at the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cs.ku.edu.tr) of [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/), working at the GGLab. I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from [Birzeit University](https://www.birzeit.edu/en), where I collaborated with [Prof. Adnan Yahya](https://www.birzeit.edu/en/faculty-staff/adnan-yahya) on knowledge extraction and semantic similarity. I also hold a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the same university.

Before starting my Ph.D., I spent 12 years working in the semiconductor software industry. My current research focuses on grounded [task-oriented dialogue systems](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.387/), [instructional text processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18529) and [benchmarking for procedural language understanding](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ijcnlp-main.52.pdf) and [planning](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.599/).
