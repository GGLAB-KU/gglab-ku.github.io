I am a Ph.D. student at the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cs.ku.edu.tr) of [Ko√ß University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/), working at the GGLab. I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from [Birzeit University](https://www.birzeit.edu/en), where I collaborated with [Prof. Adnan Yahya](https://www.birzeit.edu/en/faculty-staff/adnan-yahya) on knowledge extraction and semantic similarity. I also hold a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the same university.

Before starting my Ph.D., I spent 12 years working in the semiconductor software industry. My current research focuses on grounded task-oriented dialogue systems.
