I got my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering and M.Sc. in Data Science from [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/). During my master's, I worked on [unsupervised learning of morphology](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k3xi4NW3Ey7kAqd60mB8rtxsicT-V1_C/view) in multilingual NLP models with [Prof. Deniz Yuret](http://www.denizyuret.com/). At GGLab, I worked on measuring the likelihood of collaboration and trust to LLMs, which can be found [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3706599.3720105). My research interests include social reasoning in AI, human-AI interaction, and explainable AI.
