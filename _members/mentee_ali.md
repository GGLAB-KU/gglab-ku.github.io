I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science. As I approach my graduation at the end of Fall 2023, I have had the privilege of delving deeply into the world of NLP. Over the past year, I interned under the guidance of Asst. Prof. Gözde Gül Şahin at Koç University, where I not only gained invaluable experience but also had the opportunity to contribute as one of the authors of the paper titled "The Role of Decision-Making Similarity in Multiple Aspects of Human-AI Interaction." My aspiration in the field is clear: I aim to push the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the development of the first true AGI.

I work on programming abstractions for replicated data.
Currently, I'm the main contributor to [ConSysT](https://consyst-project.github.io/){: target="_blank" },
an object-oriented language for mixed consistency with replicated objects.
My research interests include concurrency, mixed consistency protocols, and type systems.
