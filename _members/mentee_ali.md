lastname: Gebeşçe

teaser: >
    I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science. 
    As I approach my graduation at the end of Fall 2023, 
    I have had the privilege of delving deeply into the world of NLP. 
    Over the past year, I interned under the guidance of Asst. Prof. Gözde GülŞahin at Koç University, 
    where I not only gained invaluable experience but also had the opportunity to contribute
    as one of the authors of the paper titled "The Role of Decision-Making Similarity in Multiple Aspects of Human-AI Interaction." 
    My aspiration in the field is clear: I aim to push the boundaries of what Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve, with the ultimate goal
    of contributing to the development of the first true AGI.
