I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Koç University. As I approach my graduation at the end of Fall 2023, I have had the privilege of delving deeply into the world of NLP. Over the past year, I interned under the guidance of Asst. Prof. Gözde Gül Şahin at Koç University working at the topic of cognitive trust and the decision-making similarities between humans and NLP models.
