I was a visiting research student at the GGLab after doing my master's at UC Berkeley. I spent a wonderful year working on computational morphology and Human-AI interaction. In 2023 I started my PhD at UKP Lab, TU Darmstadt where I was working on multimodal NLP. I have left to pursue an independent researcher project in NLP & Cognitive Science.
