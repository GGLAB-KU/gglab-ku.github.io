I am/was a research intern at GGLab and KUIS AI Center. From 2022 May to 2023 May, I worked on procedural language understanding from semi-structured procedural documents in low-resource languages and relationships between procedural elements such as goals, steps, and warnings/tips regarding such steps. My main research interest is the better alignment of language models in real-world tasks through procedural language understanding. Currently, I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science at Johns Hopkins University and an undergraduate researcher at JHU Center for Language and Speech Processing.
