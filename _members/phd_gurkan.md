I earned my Bachelor's degree from Sabancı University with a double major in Computer Science and Materials Science. After that, I worked as a software engineer on various web and mobile applications. Subsequently, I pursued a Master's degree at Koç University, focusing on AI. During my master's program, I specialized in multimodal neural comics understanding, with my thesis and research centered on OCR for comics, multi-task learning for comics, specifically character-to-speech bubble association, comic character re-identification, and the development of a foundational model for comics, called as ComicBERT. Currently, I am keen to shift my focus towards dialogue systems and interactivity.
