I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at UC Irvine. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor's degree from Koç University, where I had the opportunity to be a part of the GG Lab. During my time at GG Lab, I focused on Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) for Turkish and published a paper on the subject. Beyond my work in NLP, I developed an interest in the intersection of audio and image generation while working with [Prof. Aykut Erdem](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~aykut/) and [Prof. Erkut Erdem](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~erkut/) in [KUIS AI](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/) lab. Additionally, as part of my bachelor's final project, I developed [Birds of Istanbul](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=37cb40bdafe4df2eJmltdHM9MTY5NDQ3NjgwMCZpZ3VpZD0wNzdmODk5OC0zNGVkLTZmZjMtMTg4YS05YTEyMzU3ZjZlOWMmaW5zaWQ9NTE4Ng&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=077f8998-34ed-6ff3-188a-9a12357f6e9c&psq=birds+of+istanbul+app&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvYmlyZHMtb2YtaXN0YW5idWwvaWQxNjI4ODY0Mzc3&ntb=1), Turkey's first bird songs identification app, which was also released as an open-source project  [here](https://github.com/farrinfedra/BirdsOfIstanbul).
