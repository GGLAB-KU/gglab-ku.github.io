I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. Upon graduating in 2023, I was compelled to delve deeper into the field of Computer Science, particularly exploring the intricacies of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This led me to my current pursuit as a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering department at Koç University. I am currently working on robustness of multilingual language models.
