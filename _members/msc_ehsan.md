I am an M.Sc. student in Computer Science at Koç University, working with Prof. Gözde Gül Şahin at the GGLab. My research focuses on natural language processing and computational social science, particularly on identifying and analyzing language related biases in peer reviews.

Before joining Koç University, I completed my  B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). Alongside my academic work, I serve as the Technical Lead at Enlighty.ai, where I design and scale AI-powered consumer insights platforms integrating large-scale data processing and multi-tenant architectures.

My broader research interests include language bias, fairness in AI, multilingual NLP, and the intersection of language, technology, and society.
