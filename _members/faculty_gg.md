Currently, I am an Asst. Prof at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/) Computer Science and Engineering Department, where I am also affiliated with [KUIS AI](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [UKP](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) in [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp), working with [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/staff_ukp/prof_dr_iryna_gurevych/index.en.jsp). Before that, I got my PhD degree from [Computer Engineering Department](http://www.cs.itu.edu.tr/en/homepage) in Istanbul Technical University, where I was supervised by [Prof. Eşref Adalı](http://adalı.com/?page_id=4221&lang=en) and was a member of [İTÜ NLP group](https://nlp.itu.edu.tr/). During my PhD studies, I've visited [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), where I've worked with [Prof. Mark Steedman](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/). See my [personal website](https://gozdesahin.github.io/) for more details.
