I am an undergraduate student at Koç University, pursuing a double major in Physics and Computer Engineering. My research experience includes working on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics with various undergraduate research groups and contributing to an augmented reality (AR) project at the Koç University Optical Microsystems Lab. Currently, I am a researcher at GGLab, where my focus is on natural language processing (NLP).
