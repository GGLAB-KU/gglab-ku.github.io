My academic journey began at İstanbul Technical University, where I earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. Following my graduation in 2021, I embarked on a career as a full-stack data scientist in the e-commerce industry, an experience that has greatly enriched my skill set and perspective.

As of October 2023, I have embarked on a new academic journey by pursuing a master's degree in computer science and engineering at Koç University. My research focus centers on Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, in particular federated learning and low-resource languages.
