My academic journey began at İstanbul Technical University, where I earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. Following my graduation in 2021, I embarked on a career as a full-stack data scientist in the e-commerce industry, an experience that has greatly enriched my skill set and perspective.

As of October 2023, I have embarked on a new academic journey by pursuing a master's degree in computer science and engineering at Koç University. Under the esteemed guidance of Asst. Prof. Gözde Gül Şahin, my research focus centers on Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. I firmly believe that NLP represents a transformative technology with vast potential to revolutionize communication, automation, and information retrieval.

I am confident that the GGLab's dynamic environment, cutting-edge resources, and collaborative ethos will not only deepen my knowledge but also empower me to make meaningful contributions to the field of NLP.
