Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/) Computer Science and Engineering Department. I got my master's degree from the Computer Science department at [Birzeit University](https://www.birzeit.edu/en), where I worked with [Prof.Adnan Yahya](https://www.birzeit.edu/en/faculty-staff/adnan-yahya) on Knowledge Extraction and Semantic Similarity. Before that, I had a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from [Birzeit University](https://www.birzeit.edu/en) as well.  I have 12 years of experience in the semi-conductor software industry.

My research interests include task-oriented dialogues.
