I'm doing Translation Studies and Linguistics double major at Boğaziçi University. I worked as a research assistant at TÜBİTAK and the Boğaziçi Computational Social Science Lab. Currently interning at GGLab. My research focuses on machine translation, multilingual NLP, and evaluating large language models. I'm especially interested in the intersection of translation theory and computational linguistics, aiming to enhance translation quality, cross-lingual understanding, and low-resource language representation through large-scale models.
