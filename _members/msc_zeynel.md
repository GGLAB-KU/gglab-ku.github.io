I hold a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [Boğaziçi University](https://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index) and am currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en). I joined this research group during the Winter 2023 semester. Drawing from my Mathematics background, I am dedicated to leveraging my expertise to enhance NLP research. My research encompasses intriguing areas such as Neuro-symbolic Artificial Intelligence and Neural Formal Theorem Proving. My overarching goal is to assess and augment the reasoning capabilities of large language models. I firmly believe that harnessing the synergy between generative language models and symbolic logic tools will play a pivotal role in advancing the path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
