I am pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Linguistics at Stanford University. I’ve worked on computer vision, NLP and ML tasks in various internships and projects. I’ve competed in the International Linguistics Olympiad and International Olympiad in AI. I worked on Procedural Language Generation and Linguistic Puzzles as a research intern at GGLab.
