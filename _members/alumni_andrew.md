I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Engineering at Koç University. I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Koç University, with a minor in mathematics. My work at the GGLab focused on Turkish Grammatical Error Correction and Detection. My current research is with professor Aykut Erdem, working on multimodal generative models. This includes publishing a paper at ICCV2023 about video editing with generative adversarial networks (GANs).
