I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Engineering at Koç University. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Koç University, with a minor in mathematics. My work at the GGLab focused on [Turkish Grammatical Error Correction and Detection](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-ijcnlp.26/) together with Atakan and Farrin.
