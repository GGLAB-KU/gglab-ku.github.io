I was a visiting research student at the GGLab after doing my master's at UC Berkeley. I spent a wonderful year working on [computational morphology](https://aclanthology.org/anthology-files/pdf/mrl/2022.mrl-1.pdf#page=109) and [Human-AI interaction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3706599.3720105). In 2023 I started my PhD at UKP Lab, TU Darmstadt where I was working on multimodal NLP. I have left to pursue an independent researcher project in NLP & Cognitive Science.
