I am a student at Mercer Island High-School. I am also the founder of [Linguistic Justice League](https://linguisticsjusticeleague.org/). I've been selected to Forbes 30 Under 30 local and Seattle Inno Under 25 lists. I worked at GGLab as a [Fatima Fellow](https://www.fatimafellowship.com/) on text simplification.
