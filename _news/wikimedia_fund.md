First [Wikimedia Research Fund](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation) for Türkiye!

***
Translating technical content with scientific terms is still challenging for both state-of-the-art LMs and MT models. Well, we already have “dictionaries” that can guide the models for correct terminology translation, but how can we use them? We are thrilled to announce that our lab has been awarded a $40,000 grant from the Wikimedia Research Fund to investigate this. For more details about our project, please visit [here](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Bridging_the_Gap_Between_Wikipedians_and_Scientists_with_Terminology-Aware_Translation:_A_Case_Study_in_Turkish). This project also has a very special meaning since it marks us as the first ever research group from Türkiye to be awarded with Wikimedia Research Fund!
