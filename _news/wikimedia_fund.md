Wikimedia Research Fund Grant Awarded for Enhancing English-to-Turkish Wikipedia Translations

***
We are thrilled to announce that our lab has been awarded a $40,000 grant from the Wikimedia Research Fund. This project aims to address the significant gap in English-to-Turkish translations on Wikipedia, particularly in technical domains.

We plan to develop a pipeline system that will enhance the quality of translations. This initiative will leverage our domain expertise from collaborative efforts in building a terminology dictionary. Our focus extends to bridging the gap between academic researchers and the Wikipedia community, creating valuable datasets, and developing sophisticated NLP models geared towards terminology identification, linking, and translation.

We congratulate principal investigator, Asst. Prof. Gözde Gül Şahin, and lab members Gürkan, Ali, and Mina for their crucial contributions to this project.
